Development on this repo is going to be temporily paused. Photon Vision is better for pose estimation. This repo contains code for what's needed for a custom apriltag detector and basic multi-tag and multi processor ecosystem.
but now that we have got new PI5s that can run photon pretty good, devving on this sort of doesn't makes sense unfortunately. 

The proper branch to see the lastest work is [multi_process](https://github.com/Alvin-He/monovis2024/tree/multi_process)

There are various support repos for monovis, such as a unity sim, auto alignment, comms server, etc. all prefixed with monovis. Check my github profile for them. 
These support repos will also be in a limbo state. 

#### THIS REPO SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ACTUAL PRODUCTION LEVEL PERFORMANT CODE. IT ABSOULOTELY GETS OUT PERFORMED BY PHOTONVISION IF YOU HAVE THE HARDWARE.

CC Alvin-He, monovis for frc4669 -- Galileo Robotics. A c++ based apriltags system for linux. With optional CUDA Acceleration for image processing.
